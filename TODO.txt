Features:
- modulo binary operator
- add GLFW functions to read mouse position/click state
- support for equality (Klint?)

Broken things:
- Check that types match for varying linking, more thoroughly test it
- Inhibit access to global variables from gpu functions
- Add support for inout parameters to entrypoints, or disallow them
- Add builtin GLSL functions to backend to avoid name duplicates 
  with user functions

Wishlist:
- multi-dimensional arrays
- images, textures, framebuffers
- boolean matrices in GLSL
